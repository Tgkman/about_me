Theo Kokonas,

<h2>
January 4, 2003.
</h2>

<p>
I was born in a hospital in Evanston, but moved to Kennelworth when I was very little. Some years after, I moved again to where I live now in Chicago. I participate in many clubs, such as math team, quiz bowl, and coding club.

<strong>
I hope to create a fully-functioning website that has some interactive options. I don't currently know what this website will do, but I'm sure I'll think of something. I hope to incorporate some kind of informational paragraph, and possibly some redirections or multiple tabs that you can click on to show different aspects of the page. It may be something that I can use to further my current interests, or help me aquire new ones.

<a> I enjoy things such as: </a>

<!-- <p class="intro"> Here is a table of the things I do outside of school during the school week: </p>
<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<td> </td>
		<td> Monday </td>
		<td> Tuesday </td>
		<td> Wednesday </td>
		<td> Thursday </td>
		<td> Friday </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Mornings:</td>

</table>

I was going to use this table but then it lagged my whole computer and I ended up having to kill the page, so no table.

:(
